        <div class="text-2xl">
            <p class="text-3xl font-bold">3.What is event loop? How does it works?</p>
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <p><span class="underline text-3xl">Event Loop:</span>
                The event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism that allows calls that are waiting for execution in the
                callback queue to be pushed onto the call stack. The event loop performs a simple task: monitoring the
                call stack and callback queue. When the call stack is empty, the event loop catches the first event in
                the queue and passes it to the call stack, which actually fires it. This iteration is called a tick in
                the event loop.

            <p>Answer:</p>
            <p><span class="underline text-3xl">quizTimer():</span>
                The function quizTimer() sets a timer to show countdown on the webpage, it takes a parameter named
                "dismiss", which is a boolean parameter, the function clears the timer using the clearInterval() & the
                function sets an interval using the setInterval() function, which calls a function in every 1000
                milliseconds, the function take the initial value from the html element and increase its value by 1. It
                uses intervals and CSS classes to update the count and change its color every 60 seconds.

        <div class="text-2xl">
            <p class="text-3xl font-bold">5. Explain chooseQuiz()</p>
            <p>Answer:</p>
            <p><span class="underline text-3xl">chooseQuiz():</span>
                The purpose of this feature is to save the user's answers to the quiz in a table and update the saved
                answers every time the user selects an answer. The splice() and push() methods are used to update/add a
                new object to the array, and the find() function is used to check if an object with the same ID already
                exists in the response array. The UI is updated by calling the displayAnswers() function.
